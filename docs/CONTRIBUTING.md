## Principles
- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Add/maintain tests for all features.
- Update docs when behavior changes.

## Branch naming
- `feat/<short>`
- `fix/<short>`
- `chore/<short>`

## Before you open a PR
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm test`
- `npm run test:e2e` (when applicable)
